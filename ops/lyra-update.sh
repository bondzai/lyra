# Fetch the latest Lyra release and install it, if it is not the one already running.
#
# Run every five minutes by lyra-update.timer. Pushing to master builds a tarball in GitHub
# Actions; this is what picks it up.
#
# ── Why the box pulls instead of GitHub pushing ──
# The obvious design is a self-hosted Actions runner on this machine. Do not do that: this
# repository is **public**, and a self-hosted runner on a public repository will execute code from
# anyone's pull request — on a box inside your home network, with your database on it. GitHub says
# so itself. Pulling inverts it: nothing reaches in, no port is open, and the only thing this box
# trusts is a release tarball on a tag it can name. It also means deploys work from anywhere you
# can push from — the laptop, a phone, a Codespace — with no runner to register.
#
# What it does NOT do: run anything out of the tarball. The archive is unpacked and the binary is
# started by systemd as an unprivileged user; no install hook, no script from the payload.
