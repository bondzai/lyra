## Phase 17: Strategic Empire Layer

Based on the [Strategic Blueprint](./docs/intent/strategic-blueprint.md) — features that evolve Lyra from productivity tool → strategic OS.

### 17a. War Mode Protocol (Level 2)

Daily strategic protocol aligned with "1 move + 1 ignore" doctrine.

- [ ] **Daily War Card**: Morning prompt — "What is your 1 strategic move today?" + "What will you ignore?"
- [ ] **War Card history**: Track daily strategic moves over time, surface patterns
- [ ] **Leverage score**: For each task/goal, tag as leverage-building vs maintenance — track ratio
- [ ] **Signal vs Noise badge**: Tag incoming items as signal/noise during clarify, track ratio over time

### 17b. Decision Engine (Level 3)

Structured decision-making for high-stakes choices.

- [ ] **Decision log**: Record decisions with context, options considered, reasoning, outcome
- [ ] **Asymmetry check**: For each decision, rate upside/downside — flag symmetric (bad) bets
- [ ] **Second-order prompt**: When creating a goal/decision, AI asks "what happens after this succeeds?"
- [ ] **Decision review**: Weekly Review step — revisit past decisions, log actual outcomes vs expected

### 17c. Leverage Dashboard (Level 3)

Track power accumulation across flows.

- [ ] **Leverage metrics widget**: Dashboard card showing leverage ratio (leverage tasks / maintenance tasks)
- [ ] **Optionality tracker**: Tag goals/projects as optionality-creating vs optionality-consuming
- [ ] **Dependency map**: For each project, list what depends on you vs what you depend on
- [ ] **Empire metrics**: Flow volume, dependency count, switching cost — manual or derived

### 17d. Strategic Map v2 (Level 3-4)

- [ ] **Auto-link suggestions**: AI suggests connections between entities based on content/tags
- [ ] **Personal API**: Expose read-only API of your structured data for external tools/agents —
  this is the MCP life-OS read surface, Stage B of [`docs/assistant-roadmap.md`](./docs/assistant-roadmap.md)
- [ ] **Agent orchestration hooks**: Define triggers that spawn AI agents (research, review,
  strategy) — this is the job queue plus `lyra-agent`, Stages D and E of the same document

## Phase 3.5 — Superseded

### OpenClaw Integration — abandoned
OpenClaw was never built. The always-on-agent-hub role it was going to fill is filled by
`tgbot.rs`, and agent-to-agent communication is the job queue in
[`docs/assistant-roadmap.md`](./docs/assistant-roadmap.md). Kept here so the intent is traceable; the original
OpenClaw plan was deleted — nothing in it was ever built, and `git log` has it.

### Cron Jobs / Scheduled Tasks → the job queue
Daily brief generation exists today as `maybe_digest` inside `alert_loop`, with no retry: a
Telegram outage at digest hour loses the brief silently. That, habit resets and report generation
are all one thing — a durable work item with a schedule, a payload and a retry — and they are
Stage A3 / D2' of [`docs/assistant-roadmap.md`](./docs/assistant-roadmap.md).

## Nice-to-Have (Backlog)

### Google Calendar CRUD Integration

Currently: read-only iCal feed sync (public calendars only).
Goal: full bidirectional sync — create, read, update, delete events from Life-OS.

**Backend (API server)**
- [ ] **Google OAuth2 flow**: `/auth/google` → consent screen → store refresh token per user
- [ ] **Token management**: Encrypt and store Google tokens in DB, auto-refresh on expiry
- [ ] **GCal API proxy endpoints**: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/gcal/events` — backend calls Google API, frontend stays simple
- [ ] **Calendar list endpoint**: `GET /api/gcal/calendars` — list user's Google calendars with colors
- [ ] **Webhook receiver**: `POST /api/gcal/webhook` — receive push notifications from Google when events change (real-time sync)

**Frontend**
- [ ] **Google sign-in button**: OAuth connect/disconnect in Settings page
- [ ] **Calendar selector**: Choose which Google calendars to sync (checkboxes with calendar colors)
- [ ] **Unified event list**: Merge Life-OS events + Google events in calendar views, visually distinguish by source badge
- [ ] **Create event → Google**: When creating an event in Life-OS, option to push to a selected Google Calendar
- [ ] **Edit Google events inline**: Edit title, time, description of Google events directly in Life-OS calendar
- [ ] **Delete Google events**: Delete from Life-OS removes from Google (with confirmation)
- [ ] **Drag to reschedule**: Drag Google events on calendar grid → update via API
- [ ] **Conflict detection**: Warn when creating an event that overlaps with an existing Google event
- [ ] **Sync status indicator**: Show last sync time, manual refresh button, sync error states

**Sync Logic**
- [ ] **Incremental sync**: Use Google's `syncToken` to fetch only changed events (not full re-fetch)
- [ ] **Bi-directional merge**: Life-OS event changes push to Google, Google changes pull to Life-OS
- [ ] **Offline queue**: Queue changes made offline, sync when connection restores
- [ ] **Duplicate prevention**: Match events by Google event ID to avoid duplicates on re-sync

**Implementation notes**:
- Google Calendar API v3, scopes: `calendar.readonly` → `calendar.events` for write
- OAuth flow must go through backend (client secret can't be exposed)
- Store `googleEventId` in entity metadata to link Life-OS events to Google events
- Use `etag` from Google for optimistic concurrency (prevent overwriting external changes)
- Rate limits: 1M queries/day free tier, batch requests for bulk operations

### Cross-Cutting
- [ ] Bulk actions: multi-select → bulk delete, archive, status change
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts: `N` = new, `J/K` = navigate, `/` = search
- [ ] Activity timeline per entity: change history

### Tasks
- [ ] Time estimate field with tracking
- [ ] Recurring tasks (daily/weekly/monthly auto-create)
- [ ] "Blocked by" dependency indicator

### Home
- [ ] Service health monitoring (ping/heartbeat)
- [ ] Docker container status display
- [ ] Service dependency tree visualization

### Future Vision (post-API)
- [ ] Real-time multi-device sync via WebSocket
- [ ] Push notifications for due tasks/habits
- [ ] External integrations (GitHub → skills, Fitbit → health)
- [ ] Smart scheduling: AI optimal time suggestions
- [ ] Gamification: XP, levels, badges
- [ ] Mobile app (React Native or enhanced PWA)
