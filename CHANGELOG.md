# Changelog

All notable changes to Lyra are documented here.

> **Two changelogs, one of them maintained.** This file is for GitHub; `src/lib/changelog-data.ts`
> ships inside the app behind the changelog dialog and is what recorded the Lean removals. They had
> drifted a long way apart — this file stopped at 1.3.0 while the app ran to 2.5.0 — and the entries
> for 1.4.0 through 2.5.0 below are a catch-up summary of that file, not a second source of truth.
> Hand-maintaining both is what produced the drift; see the decision in
> [`docs/assistant-roadmap.md`](./docs/assistant-roadmap.md) about generating this file from the
> other.

> **The server era is versionless.** `package.json` has read `2.5.0` since April while the entire
> Rust backend, the wealth surface, the Telegram bot and the DeFi rewrite shipped underneath it.
> Those are recorded below by date rather than by version, which is honest about how they were
> released — continuously, to one box.

## Unreleased — the server era

### 2026-09-21 — The DeFi page, one screen at a time

#### Changed
- **`/wealth/defi` is one bar and one ledger.** Five equal-weight stat cards became one primary
  figure with four set inline — two levels of emphasis instead of none, at a third of the height,
  and no 3 + 2 wrap at `lg`. Out of range is a state rather than a quantity, so it filters itself:
  the number telling you to act is one click from acting.
- **Borrowed, worst health factor and ready-to-harvest moved into the bar.** Borrowed reads the
  whole book, not the filtered rows — liquidation does not care which chain you are looking at.
  Worst health factor, never an average, and coloured only below the same 1.5 threshold that gates
  the Telegram alert. Absent entirely on a wallet that does not borrow.
- **Loans joined the LP table.** The one row that can liquidate you was the one row you could not
  see. Range became Health, because an LP marker nearing its band edge and a health factor nearing
  1 are the same shape of warning. Value is the protocol-aware net, which on Aave is the debt alone
  — the collateral is already in the book as spot aTokens, and the cell spells that out.
- **The page draws on the first frame** and only the cells arrive late. A waiting figure draws a bar
  the size of its number rather than `$0.00` (a lie about someone's money) or `—` (this codebase's
  word for "we looked and could not read it").
- **Clickability is drawn, not implied.** The snowball, claimable-by-token and the borrowing panel
  open from the figures they belong to, each marked with the same expand glyph and accessible name.
- **The "In range" badge is gone.** It fired on the healthy majority and was the loudest thing in
  the row. `null` keeps a neutral badge — a range the server could not determine must never render
  as healthy — and "full range" keeps its own, because it is a different kind of position.
- **Sidebar grouped by rhythm**: Now / Plan / Money instead of Daily (2) and Plan (9). Inbox and
  Deep Work are listed; Knowledge moved to Settings and kept its route.
- **`g` + a letter jumps to any page**, shown on hover beside each sidebar item. `goKeyIndex` throws
  at import on a duplicate key.
- **One capture surface.** The `⌘⇧I` dialog, the `/`-stealing bar and the `⌘K` palette became one:
  the first character decides — bare text finds, a prefix creates, `/ask` asks.

#### Removed
- The notifications *page*. It was the list the bell already drops down, plus two buttons that now
  live in the dropdown.
- Six components nothing imported, and 533 lines nothing could reach.

#### Fixed
- Four copies of "how long ago" and three of "what is this day's key" collapsed into
  `src/lib/dates.ts`. One of the three was a real bug: the week view built its key with
  `toISOString()`, so east of Greenwich every column keyed one day behind the month view beside it.
- Wealth win/loss colours raised to AA contrast.

### 2026-09-20 — Projects are a type again

#### Added
- **Projects has its own type and page.** March merged Project into Goal; that was right for a goal
  tree and wrong for a body of work. No migration and no new table — the live database held zero
  project entities, so the merge was complete and this reverses it cleanly. The optional half
  (client, repo, stack) lives in `metadata`.
- **A task can say which project it belongs to.** The picker offers projects and goals, grouped,
  and drops archived entries. One `metadata.projectId` field serves both, because ids are unique
  across types — two fields would mean rewriting every existing row to guess what an old id meant.

#### Changed
- Project progress is derived from task counts, never stored. Which project is open lives in the
  URL, not in state.
- Deleting a project says what happens to its tasks: the API hard-deletes with no cascade, so they
  stay and lose their project. A dangling id reads as "Unknown (deleted)".

### 2026-09-19 — A second channel

#### Added
- **Discord delivery.** The webhook URL ends in a token, so it is the credential: no `Display`, a
  hand-written `Debug` that prints `[redacted]`, no public accessor, every error path scrubbed, and
  the **host checked on construction** — a "which host do we post to" setting is a
  credential-exfiltration switch. `http://` is refused too. Configured with `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`.
- **`telegram_to_discord`**, because two markdowns that look alike are the trap worth a translator:
  Telegram reads `*bold*`, Discord reads `**bold**`, and passing one to the other emphasises every
  digest heading the wrong way — quietly.
- **`Channels` fans one alert out to every configured channel.** Delivered means delivered
  *somewhere*: an alert that reached your phone has done its job, and failing the sweep because
  Discord was down would turn redundancy into a new way to lose an alert. Nothing configured is
  still `NotConfigured`, never a failure.

#### Fixed
- **The transport decides how to escape, not the author.** Bot replies built from on-chain names
  went out with `parse_mode: Markdown`; one `*` in a pool name and Telegram rejected the whole
  request, so the reply was silently never delivered. `Message::plain` is now escaped by the sender
  and `Message::telegram_markup` passed through. Escaping strips rather than backslash-escapes,
  because removal cannot produce an unbalanced entity.

#### Known
- `/api/wealth/alerts` still reports `can_send` for Telegram alone, so a Discord-only box delivers
  alerts while the settings page says it cannot. That field is parity-gated; widening it would fail
  the diff. Documented at `telegram_ready` and in [`docs/features/alerts.md`](./docs/features/alerts.md).

### 2026-09-17 — Opportunities, and what pays an APR

#### Added
- **The Opportunities board** (`/wealth/opportunities`): vfat's whole universe — thousands of pools
  across 63 protocols — rather than only what beats what you already hold. Every control is a query
  parameter, because filtering in the browser would be slower and would throw away facets their API
  already computes.
- **APR basis on every row.** Two WETH/USDC rows quoted 86.9% and 72.0%; the higher one was entirely
  staking emissions and the lower one entirely swap fees, and nothing said so. Each row now names
  what pays it and flags a window resting on less data than it claims.
- **`vfat-status`** reads `/v4/aggregation-delay` and reports how far behind vfat's own view of each
  chain is. This is the failure `LAST_GOOD_MAX_AGE_SECS` was written to survive without being able
  to name: farm-balances answers 200 with data that is quietly hours old.

Both new routes sit **outside the parity gate** deliberately — they answer questions the Python was
never asked, and `portfolio` and `yield-radar` cannot grow fields without failing the diff.

### 2026-09-06 — What a position has actually made

#### Added
- **LP position performance** via vfat's `position-performance`, undocumented until they published
  their OpenAPI. One request per wallet for the whole portfolio, singleflighted behind the same
  per-key lock `farm_balances` uses.
- **`marks.tsx`** — shape encodes kind, so a column of identical grey dots stops being a column
  carrying no information.
- **Chain display names in `identity.ts`.** `chainLabel` title-cased the API's slug, so every table
  said "Bnb", "Hyperevm" and "Kucoin" — names nobody uses, which read as a data bug.

#### Changed
- Claimable-by-token became a ranked list filled to each token's share of the *total*, so "one token
  is most of this, the rest is dust" lands before a number is read.
- Token amounts stopped rendering in scientific notation.

### 2026-08-21 → 2026-08-23 — Telegram answers back

#### Added
- **The Telegram command bot** (`tgbot.rs`). `lyra-alerts` pushed alerts out; this pulls commands
  in. Eleven wealth commands, long-polled rather than webhooked because the box sits behind a home
  router with nothing forwarded. Only the pinned `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` is answered — a stranger's
  message is counted and dropped, never answered and never echoed. See
  [`docs/features/telegram.md`](./docs/features/telegram.md).
- **Off-chain assets** get a server-side home, so the net-worth snapshot counts them.
- **The book reads in USD, THB or sats.**
- **Wallets are managed in the app**, and non-EVM ones stop being dropped.
- **Lyra runs as a local service from one binary**, with the stack verified through nginx.

#### Fixed
- **The bot token was in the logs.** `reqwest::Error` renders the URL it failed on, and that URL
  carries the token, so every transient blip wrote the secret to `server.log` in plain text. Both
  call sites now log `e.without_url()`. **Rotate the token if a log from before 2026-08-23 ever left
  this machine.**
- **A malformed poll URL failed exactly like an outage.** Nine literal spaces from a
  `\`-continuation meant every poll failed for a day while messages queued unread, and the log said
  `error sending request` — which is what a network problem says too. `updates_url` builds it on one
  line now, with a test.
- HyperEVM spot is read over RPC, since its indexer is gone.

### 2026-03 → 2026-08 — The Rust port

#### Changed
- **The TypeScript backend is gone and the Rust stack is the only one.** One `axum` + `sqlx` binary
  over SQLite in WAL, forward-only migrations applied at startup, and the chain fan-out and alert
  sweep in-process so their upstream caches are shared with the request path — an alert can never
  disagree with the page it points at.
- **The Python oracle was deleted**, keeping its data and a way back, once the parity harness had
  gated portfolio, yield-radar, alerts and services at 0.5%.

#### Added
- `lyra-mcp`, the MCP research desk: ten wealth tools over a keyless portfolio, read-only by
  construction. See [`docs/features/mcp.md`](./docs/features/mcp.md).
- Git-backed knowledge notes, the whole wealth surface on live data, and the deployment stack.

---

## [2.5.0] — 2026-04-02 — Lean

#### Removed
- **Sidebar cut from 17 items to 8.** Removed pages: Lyra, Timeline/Gantt, Events, Note Map, Goal
  Map, Skills, Sessions, Learning, Travel, Family, Health, Wealth, Projects. Chat stayed available
  through the sidebar; `⌘K` still navigated everywhere remaining.
- Precache fell from 3418 KB to 1857 KB.

*Wealth and Projects have both since returned — Wealth as the Rust-backed module, Projects as its
own type in September.*

## [2.4.9] — 2026-03-31 — Lyra Protocol

#### Added
- Settings page, configurable keybindings with OS-conflict detection, briefing window (`⌘⇧B`),
  Deep Work shortcut (`⌘⇧D`), accordion subtasks, "move under…", promote-to-task, pretty-JSON note

#### Changed
- **Entity simplification**: Project merged into Goal, Chore into Task — three mental models:
  outcome, action, system. *(The Project half was reversed in September; see 2026-09-20.)*
