//! The chain config table — port of `portfolio.py:56-158` (`CHAINS`, `NATIVE`), plus the
//! chain-kind registry (`CHAIN_KINDS`/`_kind`, ~line 2131) and `_order_chains` (~line 2358).
//!
//! Single source of truth, exactly as in Python: adding a chain is one entry here, not a new
//! field scattered across five modules. The fields are deliberately `Option`, mirroring the
//! Python dict's `.get()` shape — a chain without `blockscout` has no token indexer and is
//! native-coin-only, and a chain without `native` (Hyperliquid's order book) has no coin at all.
//! Filling those holes in with plausible-looking defaults would invent behaviour the Python
//! original never had, so they stay empty and the callers branch on them.
