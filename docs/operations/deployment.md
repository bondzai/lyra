# Deployment

Lyra runs as **one binary**. The release `lyra-api` serves the API and the built front end from the
same origin — no nginx, no node at runtime, and therefore no CORS to configure.

There are two supported hosts, and they are the same shape:

| | Host | Supervisor | Installer | Prefix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **The box** | mini PC, Ubuntu 24.04 under WSL2 | systemd | `ops/lyra-server-linux.sh` | `/opt/lyra` |
| **A laptop** | macOS | launchd | `ops/lyra-server.sh` | `~/Library/Application Support/Lyra` |

> **The four-container compose stack is gone.** It ran `api` + `ui`/nginx + `ollama` + a `migrate`
> one-shot; three of those existed to do what `LYRA_UI_DIR` now does inside the binary. The files
> (`docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile.ui`, `core/Dockerfile`) are still in the tree and still build,
> but nothing here uses them and `core/Dockerfile` has never contained the front end — a container
> built from it serves the API only. `git log` has the old instructions.

## 1. The pipeline

Deploys are **pull-based**, and that is a security decision, not a convenience one.

```

**Why not a self-hosted runner.** This repository is public. A self-hosted runner on a public
repository runs code from anyone's pull request, on the machine it is installed on — here a box
inside a home network with the database on it. GitHub documents this as a reason not to do it.
Pulling costs five minutes of latency and deletes the entire class of problem: nothing reaches in,
no port is open, and the box trusts only a release tarball whose checksum it can verify.

**Why the box does not build.** `[profile.release]` is `lto = "fat"` with `codegen-units = 1` over
~400 crates. That is minutes on a CI runner with a warm cache and a long time on a mini PC whose
job is answering requests. The cost is paid once, in Actions, for free.

**`ubuntu-24.04` is pinned in both workflows, not `ubuntu-latest`.** The binary is dynamically
linked against the builder's glibc. The day `ubuntu-latest` moves, every deploy onto Ubuntu 24.04
dies with `GLIBC_2.4x not found` — on a binary that built and tested perfectly. **If the distro on
the box changes, change that line in the same commit.**

---

## 2. Preparing the box (once)

### Windows

It is a server now, so stop it sleeping:

```powershell
powercfg /change standby-timeout-ac 0
powercfg /change hibernate-timeout-ac 0
powercfg -h off
```

In the BIOS, turn on "restore on AC power loss" if it is there. Then:

```powershell
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04
```

**Ubuntu 24.04 specifically** — it has to match `ubuntu-24.04` in the workflows.

`%UserProfile%\.wslconfig`:

```ini
[wsl2]
memory=8GB
processors=4
# Without this, a port inside WSL is reachable from Windows and from nowhere else — not the LAN,
# not Tailscale. Needs Windows 11 22H2 or newer.
networkingMode=mirrored
```

WSL does not boot until something asks it to, so a service that "starts at boot" does not. Create a
Task Scheduler task — **At startup**, *Run whether user is logged on or not*:

```
wsl.exe -d Ubuntu-24.04 --exec /bin/true
```

Then `wsl --shutdown` and start it again to pick up `.wslconfig`.

### Inside WSL

```bash
sudo tee /etc/wsl.conf >/dev/null <<'EOF'
[boot]
systemd=true
EOF
```

`wsl --shutdown` from PowerShell again, then reopen. `systemctl is-system-running` should answer
something other than `offline`.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y sqlite3 curl rsync ca-certificates git
# DIGEST_HOUR and HABITS_NUDGE_HOUR are LOCAL hours. Get this wrong and the daily brief
# arrives at the wrong time, with nothing anywhere saying why.
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Bangkok
```

---

## 3. Installing the service

Clone the repo and give it the secrets. `.env.local` is gitignored and is the only copy on this box
of the KuCoin key and the Telegram token — **carry it over out of band** (USB, or `scp` over
Tailscale). Never through git: this repository is public.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bondzai/life-os-ui.git ~/lyra
cd ~/lyra
# from the laptop, or retyped
install -m 600 /path/to/.env.local .env.local
sudo ./ops/lyra-server-linux.sh setup
```

`setup` creates the `lyra` system user and `/opt/lyra`, writes `/etc/lyra/lyra.env` from
`.env.local`, installs the unit plus the update and backup timers, and enables everything. With no
binary yet it says so; the update timer fetches the latest release within five minutes, or:

```bash
sudo /opt/lyra/bin/lyra-update.sh
```

### The layout

```
/opt/lyra/bin/lyra-api        the running binary
         /ui/                 the built front end (LYRA_UI_DIR points here)
         /data/lyra.db        the database — the only thing here that is not replaceable
         /releases/<tag>/     what was unpacked; rollback is a swap back to the previous one
         /backups/            nightly VACUUM INTO, 14 days
         /.version            the installed tag, compared by the updater
/etc/lyra/lyra.env            every setting, mode 640 root:lyra
```

### Settings

`/etc/lyra/lyra.env` is generated — **do not edit it**, `setup` overwrites it. Edit `.env.local` in
the checkout and re-run `setup`.

What it contains is the allowlist in **`ops/service-env.list`**, which both installers read. A
variable the server reads and that file does not name is silently absent in production: set in
`.env.local`, working under `cargo run`, dead on the box. That has happened once, to
`DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` and the Google OAuth keys. `the_install_script_forwards_every_setting_the_server_reads`
in `crates/lyra-api/src/main.rs` reads the list and fails naming the variable and its source file,
so it cannot happen quietly again.

`PORT`, `LYRA_DB` and `LYRA_UI_DIR` come from the install layout. `LYRA_HTTP_CACHE` and
`LYRA_HTTP_FIXTURES` are deliberately never forwarded — they point the chain client at recorded test
responses, and forwarding them would let a stray line in `.env.local` make production report
fixture balances as your money.

---

## 4. Moving the database

A hard cutover. **Not a migration, and there is no overlap window.**

The Telegram bot long-polls `getUpdates` (`tgbot.rs`, deliberately — a webhook would need a public
HTTPS endpoint). Two processes on one token fight over updates and drop them. Two instances also
send two daily digests and run two alert sweeps.

```bash
# 1. On the laptop — STOP IT FIRST.
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/sh.lyra.server

# 2. One consistent file. VACUUM INTO rather than cp or .backup: this database runs in WAL mode,
#    so lyra.db alone is missing whatever is still in lyra.db-wal, and VACUUM INTO writes a single
#    compacted file with no sidecars — nothing left to forget to copy.
sqlite3 "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Lyra/data/lyra.db" \
  "VACUUM INTO '/tmp/lyra-move.db'"

# 3. Check it before you trust it.
sqlite3 /tmp/lyra-move.db "pragma integrity_check; select count(*) from entities;"

# 4. Carry it over, then on the box:
sudo systemctl stop lyra
sudo install -o lyra -g lyra -m 600 /path/to/lyra-move.db /opt/lyra/data/lyra.db
sudo rm -f /opt/lyra/data/lyra.db-wal /opt/lyra/data/lyra.db-shm
sudo systemctl start lyra
curl -sf localhost:3030/api/health && echo ok
```

Deleting the sidecars in step 4 matters: a stale `-wal` left beside a fresh `.db` is the classic way
to corrupt the result.

Keep the laptop's database for a couple of weeks. It is the rollback.

Migrations run forward-only at startup against `PRAGMA user_version`, so the new binary upgrades the
schema on first boot. An **older** binary refuses to open a newer database — which is why
`deploy` health-checks and rolls back rather than leaving a half-started service.

---

## 5. Backups and restore

**`deploy` takes its own copy first**, `pre-<tag>.db`, before it swaps anything. A migration is a
one-way door: a release that moves `user_version` forward leaves a database the previous binary
refuses to open, so the automatic rollback would put an older binary on a newer file and the service
would not start at all. Restoring that copy is the way out, and the failure message prints the three
commands. It refuses to deploy if the backup fails, because a box where `sqlite3` is missing is a box
whose nightly backups have been failing too.

`lyra-backup.timer` runs nightly at 03:30: `VACUUM INTO /opt/lyra/backups/lyra-YYYYMMDD.db`, keeping
14 days. One consistent, compacted file per night, no sidecars, safe to run against a live database.

At roughly half a megabyte, offsite is cheap: `rclone` to Cloudflare R2 (10 GB free) or any free
drive. **Back up `.env.local` alongside it** — a restored `lyra.db` with no `.env.local` is a system
that comes up showing an empty book.

Litestream is not used here. It streams the WAL continuously, which is the right tool for a database
orders of magnitude larger than this one.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop lyra
# All three, or a stale -wal beside a fresh .db corrupts the result.
sudo rm -f /opt/lyra/data/lyra.db /opt/lyra/data/lyra.db-wal /opt/lyra/data/lyra.db-shm
sudo install -o lyra -g lyra -m 600 /opt/lyra/backups/lyra-20260925.db /opt/lyra/data/lyra.db
sudo systemctl start lyra
curl -sf localhost:3030/api/health && echo ok
```

---

## 6. When something is wrong

```bash
./ops/lyra-server-linux.sh status     # active? which tag? when do the timers next fire?
./ops/lyra-server-linux.sh logs       # journalctl -u lyra -f
journalctl -u lyra-update -n 50       # why a deploy did or did not happen
systemctl list-timers 'lyra-*'
```

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| `FATAL: JWT_SECRET environment variable is required` | Not in `.env.local`, so not in `lyra.env`. `openssl rand -base64 48`, then re-run `setup` |
| Unit is active, port answers nothing | `journalctl -u lyra` for a migration failure. An **older** binary cannot open a **newer** database |
| `attempt to write a readonly database` | The `data/` **directory** must be writable by `lyra`, not just the file — WAL mode creates two sidecars beside it |
| Pages render their error state against a healthy server | The bundle was built without `VITE_API_URL=/api`. `release.yml` sets it; a hand-built `dist/` may not |
| A blank Holdings page, nothing in the log | A wealth variable is missing from `ops/service-env.list` or from `.env.local` — §7.1 |
| The daily brief arrives at the wrong hour | `timedatectl`. `DIGEST_HOUR` is a **local** hour |
| The service does not come back after a reboot | The Windows Task Scheduler task that boots WSL is missing or did not run — §2 |
| `GLIBC_2.4x not found` | The runner image and the WSL distro have diverged — §1 |
| Deploys stopped arriving | `systemctl list-timers 'lyra-*'`, then `journalctl -u lyra-update` |
| Telegram replies twice, or drops messages | Two instances share one bot token — §4 |
| Ports: only **3030** | The whole application. Ollama, if added, is 11434 and must be reachable *from the browser* — the API never proxies it, so a phone that cannot reach it shows AI offline and falls back to algorithmic mode |

---

## 7. Settings reference

Read from the source (`crates/lyra-api/src/main.rs`, `gcal.rs`, `knowledge.rs`), not from memory.
Which of these the *installed service* actually receives is the allowlist in
**`ops/service-env.list`** — see §3.

| Variable | Required | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `JWT_SECRET` | **Yes** | — | Signs session tokens. Missing or empty → process exits 1. Generate: `openssl rand -base64 48`. Rotating it logs everyone out |
| `LYRA_DB` | No | `data/lyra.db` | SQLite path. The installers set it from the install layout |
| `LYRA_UI_DIR` | No | unset | Directory of the built front end. **Unset serves the API only**; set, one binary is the whole application. No `index.html` inside it logs a warning and serves the API only |
| `PORT` | No | `3001` | Listen port, bound on `0.0.0.0`. Both installers set `3030` |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | No | `http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:8080` | Comma-separated allow-list. Irrelevant when the binary serves the UI (same-origin); matters for direct API access — a phone on the LAN, a local `npm run dev` |
| `RUST_LOG` | No | `info` | Tracing filter, e.g. `lyra_api=debug,info` |
| `LYRA_JOBS` | No | on | The job queue. Off, the Agents page stays empty and nothing is queued |
| `LYRA_KNOWLEDGE_PATH` | No | `../lyra-knowledge` relative to cwd | Markdown knowledge repo |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | No | — | Google OAuth. Without it the calendar endpoints return "Google OAuth not configured" and nothing else is affected |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | No | — | Token exchange and refresh |
| `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` | No | — | Must match the Google Cloud Console **byte for byte** |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | No | `http://localhost:5173` | Where the OAuth callback redirects the browser back to. Set it, or Google auth lands on the dev server |
| `GCAL_API_KEY` | No | built-in public embed key | Only for public calendar reads |
| `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` / `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` | No | `Lyra` / `lyra@localhost` | Identity for knowledge-note commits. Without one `git commit` fails, and the failure is ignored on purpose — notes save, history does not |

Deliberately never forwarded to the service: `LYRA_HTTP_CACHE` and `LYRA_HTTP_FIXTURES`, which point
the chain client at recorded test responses. Forwarding them would let a stray line in `.env.local`
make production report fixture balances as your money.

Build-time only, inlined into the JS bundle — they do nothing as runtime variables:

| Build arg | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_USE_API` | `true` | `true` = talk to the API; anything else = browser-local storage |
| `VITE_API_URL` | dev-server URL | Must be `/api` for same-origin serving. `release.yml` sets it |

### 7.1 Wealth

Nothing here is required. Without them the API starts, serves every route, and reports an empty
book; the sweep runs and finds nothing to say. **A blank page is the symptom of a missing variable,
rather than a crash** — which is why §6 lists it.

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ALERT_WALLETS` | — | Wallets the sweep and the digest cover. Comma/space separated `0x…` and/or `bc1…`. The wealth pages take their addresses from the request, not from this |
| `KUCOIN_API_KEY` / `_SECRET` / `_PASSPHRASE` | — | Read-only exchange credentials. **Do not grant trade permission** — nothing in this stack places an order, so a key that can trade only adds blast radius |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | — | Unset, `/alerts/test` and `/alerts/digest` answer `400` and the sweep still runs, recording state without sending. That is the right first-boot state |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | — | Where alerts go |
| `TELEGRAM_OWNER_USER_ID` | — | Which row in `users` the life commands read, for `/today`, `/next`, `/inbox`, `/week` and the habits nudge. Unset with exactly one user is fine — it is inferred. Unset with several, or naming a user that does not exist, leaves the money commands working and the life commands declining |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | — | The second channel. **The whole URL is the credential** — its last path segment is a token, so anyone holding it can post to that channel. The host is checked on construction, so a typo fails rather than posting your portfolio somewhere else. **Setting this turns on live delivery to a live channel.** See [Alerts](../features/alerts.md) |
| `ALERT_INTERVAL` | `900` | Seconds between sweeps |
| `SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL` | — | Seconds between net-worth snapshots |
| `SNAPSHOT_GROUP` | — | Group the snapshot cron writes under |
| `DIGEST_HOUR` | — | **Local** hour for the daily brief. **Unset means no digest is ever sent** |
| `HABITS_NUDGE_HOUR` | — | **Local** hour to message you about recurrences that are due. **Unset means never**, which is the default: the daily brief already arrives, and a second unsolicited message is a choice rather than a setting to find and turn off. Reads `schedules`; writes nothing, and never touches `nextDue` — see [Core engine](../architecture/core-engine.md) |
| `ALERT_FEE_USD` | — | Claimable threshold that triggers a harvest nudge |
| `ALERT_HF` | — | Health factor below which a borrow is called out |
| `ALERT_REPORT_CCY` | — | Currency the digest reports in |
| `REQUEST_DEADLINE` | — | Chain fan-out budget in seconds |
| `ADAPTER_CONCURRENCY` | — | Parallel adapter reads |

`.env.local` is the only copy on disk of the KuCoin key and the Telegram token. Back it up alongside
the database.

**The first sweep is silent, the second is not.** A fresh `alert_state` baselines without sending;
once it has a baseline, a real change sends a real message to a real phone. When testing, either
stop the API inside `ALERT_INTERVAL` or leave `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` unset.

### 7.2 The MCP research desk

`lyra-mcp` is a **separate stdio process**, not a service — an MCP client launches it as a child and
talks JSON-RPC over its stdin/stdout. It is not part of the deployment above because there is
nothing for it to listen on, and it is not fetched by the release pipeline: it runs wherever the
client runs, which is usually the laptop.

```bash
cd core && cargo build --release --bin lyra-mcp
```

Register it with the client (Claude Desktop / Claude Code):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "proof-of-wealth": {
      "command": "/path/to/lyra/core/target/release/lyra-mcp",
      "env": { "LYRA_DB": "/path/to/lyra.db", "POW_WALLETS": "0x…,bc1…" }
    }
  }
}
```

Two things to get right:

- **`LYRA_DB` must be the same database the API uses**, or the analysis journal the desk writes is a
  different journal from the one the Journal page reads. Pointing it at the mini PC's database means
  pointing it at a file over a network mount — SQLite over a network filesystem is a way to corrupt
  a database, so prefer running the desk on the box itself, or against a `VACUUM INTO` copy.
- **Wallets come from `POW_WALLETS`, falling back to `ALERT_WALLETS`.** The desk is a research tool
  and gets its own setting on purpose — pointing it at a subset of the book is a reasonable thing to
  want. But requiring the same list under a second name on a single-user box only produces two lists
  that drift, so an unset or blank `POW_WALLETS` means "whatever the sweep watches".

It refuses to start if any signing variable (`PRIVATE_KEY`, `MNEMONIC`, `SEED_PHRASE`, …) is in its
environment, and refuses any `MCP_TRANSPORT` but stdio. Both exit 1 with the reason on stderr.

**The tool surface, the read-only invariant and what each guarantee actually buys are in
[`docs/features/mcp.md`](../features/mcp.md).** This section is build-and-register only.

---

## 8. Remote access

**Tailscale**, free tier — 100 devices, 3 users. On the box (the Windows side is simplest, with
mirrored networking from §2):

```bash
tailscale up
tailscale serve --https=443 http://localhost:3030
```

**Use HTTPS, not plain HTTP over the tailnet.** Lyra is a PWA and service workers require a secure
context; over `http://minipc:3030` the worker silently never registers and you lose offline and
install. `tailscale serve` gives a real certificate for free.

Then add the `*.ts.net` origin to `FRONTEND_URL`, `CORS_ORIGINS` and `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` — in
`.env.local` **and** in the Google Console, byte for byte — and re-run `setup`.

**Do not port-forward.** If you want a shell fallback instead:
`ssh -L 3030:localhost:3030 you@minipc`.

---

## 9. Updates

Push to `master`. That is the whole procedure — `release.yml` gates and builds, and the box installs
the new tag within five minutes.

```bash
sudo /opt/lyra/bin/lyra-update.sh          # don't wait for the timer
sudo ./ops/lyra-server-linux.sh rollback   # back to the previous release
```

`deploy` health-checks after restarting and **rolls itself back** if the new binary does not answer,
so a bad build costs a minute of downtime rather than an evening. Exactly one previous release is
kept: two is a rollback target, ten is a disk that fills up on a box nobody is watching.

Migrations run forward-only at startup against `PRAGMA user_version`. They are append-only by
policy, so a rollback of the *binary* across a migration boundary will fail to open the database —
that is the one case where you restore a backup from §5 instead.

Changing settings is not a deploy: edit `.env.local` in the checkout on the box and re-run
`sudo ./ops/lyra-server-linux.sh setup`.

---

## 10. What is deliberately not automated

- **`.env.local` never travels through CI.** No secret is needed to build: the bundle is
  configuration-free apart from `VITE_API_URL`, and every runtime setting is read on the box. There
  are no GitHub Actions secrets in this pipeline at all.
- **The parity gate is not in CI.** `parity.toml` points at a Python oracle on `127.0.0.1:8000` that
  exists only on the author's laptop. Run `make parity` there. See [parity](./parity.md).
- **`npm run lint` does not gate.** 58 pre-existing errors; it runs in `ci.yml` reporting only. A
  check that is red the day you add it teaches everyone to ignore checks. Clean them, then drop the
  `|| true` in `ci.yml`.
