# Lyra — Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

- **Node 24** — `nvm use` in this directory picks it up from `.nvmrc`. The shell default of 18
  is too old for Vite 7.
- **Rust** — Homebrew's rustup keg only links `rustup`; the cargo/rustc shims live in
  `/opt/homebrew/opt/rustup/bin`, which the `Makefile` prepends for you.
- Git, and Docker if you want the container stack.

## Quick Start (Local Development)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bondzai/life-os-ui.git
cd life-os-ui
nvm use && npm install

# Terminal 1 — the Rust API on :3001
export JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 48)"
make dev-api

# Terminal 2 — the front end on :5174
make dev-ui
```

Then sign in and pick **API** mode; the PIN is whatever is in your database (`1234` on a fresh
seed). The choice is stored as `lyra:data-mode` and is what every repository — entities,
trackers, and the wealth surfaces alike — reads to decide whether it is talking to the server or
to browser-local demo data. `VITE_USE_API=true` in a root `.env` sets the default for a session
that has not chosen.

**Wealth needs a little more.** The wealth pages read live chain data, which the server fetches
for the addresses in `ALERT_WALLETS`, and the KuCoin account needs read-only API credentials.
All of it lives in `.env.local` (gitignored, mode 600); `.env.example` documents every name. With
none of it set the API still starts and every page renders an empty book — a blank Holdings page
is the symptom of a missing variable, not a crash.

**The MCP research desk** is a separate stdio binary, `make mcp`. See
[Deployment §7.2](./deployment.md).

## Deployment

Lyra is meant to run on a mini PC in your house, not in someone else's cloud: it holds a live
picture of your net worth, and the whole point of a keyless design is that nothing about it has
to leave the LAN.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build      # UI on :8080, Ollama on :11434
```

The full procedure — first run, bringing the legacy database across, backups, restore,
troubleshooting, and every environment variable — is in [Deployment](./deployment.md).

The earlier Render + Turso instructions are gone with the Hono API they deployed. For access
from outside the house, put the box on a tailnet rather than forwarding a port; see
[Deployment §8](./deployment.md).

## Data Backup Migrations (localStorage)

Export/import handles schema changes automatically. Backups are versioned — when you import an older backup, it runs migrations to transform the data to the current schema.

**Location:** `src/lib/data-backup.ts`

### How It Works

1. Every export stamps `CURRENT_VERSION` (e.g. `2`)
2. On import, if the backup version is older, migrations run sequentially (v1→v2→v3→...)
3. Legacy backups without a version are treated as v1

### When You Change Schema

1. Bump `CURRENT_VERSION`
2. Add a migration function to `MIGRATIONS`

```typescript
// src/lib/data-backup.ts

const CURRENT_VERSION = 3  // ← bump

const MIGRATIONS: Record<number, MigrationFn> = {
  1: migrateV1toV2,
  2: (data) => {  // ← add migration from v2 → v3
    const entities = (data['lyra:entities'] ?? []) as Record<string, unknown>[]
    for (const e of entities) {
      if (!e.color) e.color = 'default'  // new required field
    }
    return data
  },
}
```

### Rules

- Each migration transforms data from version N to N+1
- Migrations must be backwards-compatible (never remove a migration)
- Importing a backup from a newer version is rejected with a clear error

---

## Database Migrations

Forward-only SQL in `core/crates/lyra-db/src/migrations`, applied automatically when the API
starts and tracked by `PRAGMA user_version`. There is nothing to generate and nothing to run by
hand: no ORM sits between the code and the schema.

To add a column, write the next numbered migration and bump the version. To bring a legacy
database across, `make db-migrate` — the importer is `INSERT OR IGNORE`, so re-running it after
the old system has moved on is safe and picks up only what is new.

## API Endpoints

All protected routes require `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` header.

## Environment Variables Reference

### Frontend (root `.env`)

| Variable         | Default | Description                     |
|------------------|---------|---------------------------------|
| `VITE_USE_API`   | —       | Set `true` to use backend API   |
| `VITE_API_URL`   | —       | API base URL (e.g. `/api`)      |

### Backend

`JWT_SECRET` is the only required one — missing or empty and the process exits 1 rather than sign
tokens with a fallback secret.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `JWT_SECRET` | *required* | Signs session tokens |
| `LYRA_DB` | `data/lyra.db` | SQLite path. WAL mode, so it always has `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars — back up all three or none |
| `PORT` | `3001` | Listen port |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:8080` | Comma-separated allow-list |
| `RUST_LOG` | `info` | Tracing filter |
| `LYRA_KNOWLEDGE_PATH` | `../lyra-knowledge` | Markdown notes repo; `/api/knowledge` 404s without it |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `_SECRET` / `_REDIRECT_URI` | — | Calendar OAuth |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | `http://localhost:5173` | Where the OAuth callback returns to |

Wealth and alert variables — `ALERT_WALLETS`, the KuCoin credentials, the Telegram token, the
Discord webhook (`DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`), the sweep thresholds — are in
[Deployment §7.1](./deployment.md). All optional; without them the book is empty and the sweep
records state without sending.

**Setting either channel turns on live delivery.** The first sweep after a fresh `alert_state`
baselines silently; the second sends a real message to a real phone or channel. See
[Alerts](../features/alerts.md).
