## Overview

Lyra (formerly Life-OS) is a long-term personal project — a unified web application that replaces scattered tools (Google Sheets for budgets, random apps for habits, browser tabs for server monitoring) with a single, clean dashboard.

It runs on a local home server, serves a household of two (expandable), and integrates with external services through a plugin-based connector system. The Lyra AI assistant — powered by a local LLM via Ollama — acts as a proactive co-pilot with full context of your data, surfacing insights and coaching without being asked.

**This is not a product. It is infrastructure for life.**

---

## Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Own your data** | Everything runs locally. No third-party SaaS owns your life data. External services are optional connectors. |
| **DRY core, thin modules** | One entity system, one tracker, one automation engine. Modules are configuration over code. |
| **Two users, not two thousand** | Optimize for simplicity and personal utility, not scale. No need for complex multi-tenancy. |
| **AI as co-pilot** | AI reads your data, surfaces insights, and takes actions — but you stay in control. Local-first via Ollama. |
| **Proactive over reactive** | The system should tell you what needs attention before you ask. Pulse detectors, morning briefs, celebrations. |
| **Incremental growth** | Ship one module at a time. Each phase must be independently useful. |
| **Boring technology** | Pick stable, well-documented tools. Avoid hype-driven choices. |

---

## Users

| User | Role | Access |
|---|---|---|
| **JB** | Admin | Full access — all modules, server controls, system config |
| **Wife** | Member | Full access to life modules, optional access to server/infra |

Authentication is lightweight — PIN or local password. No OAuth complexity needed for a home network. Each user has their own dashboard, preferences, and private entities. Shared entities (family goals, household budget) are visible to both.

**Separation of concerns:**

- **UI** — Presentation, interaction, client state. Knows nothing about databases.
- **API Server** — Business logic, persistence, connector orchestration. Knows nothing about UI.
- **AI Layer** — Sol personality, MCP-style tools, Pulse detectors, context builders. Runs across all modules.
- **Connectors** — Isolated plugins that bridge external services to the core data model.

## Core Engine

Everything in Lyra is built on four primitives. This is the foundation that makes the system DRY — every module reuses the same data structures, CRUD operations, and UI components.

### Entity

The universal record. Every item in the system — a goal, a task, a transaction, a habit, a device — is an Entity.

```
Entity
├── id              unique identifier
├── type            "goal" | "task" | "habit" | "transaction" | "project" | ...
├── title           display name
├── description     optional detail (markdown)
├── status          "active" | "completed" | "archived" | "paused"
├── priority        "low" | "medium" | "high" | "urgent"
├── tags            string[] — flexible categorization
├── metadata        key-value pairs — module-specific fields
├── parentId        optional — for hierarchy (goal → sub-goal)
├── ownerId         which user owns this
├── visibility      "private" | "shared"
├── dueDate         optional deadline
├── createdAt       timestamp
└── updatedAt       timestamp
```

The `metadata` field is intentionally flexible. A transaction entity stores `{ amount, currency, category }` in metadata. A workout stores `{ exercise, sets, reps, weight }`. A project stores `{ stack, velocity, repoUrl }`. This avoids a separate table per module while keeping the core schema stable.

### Tracker

A time-series data point attached to any entity. Used for anything measured over time.

```
Tracker
├── id
├── entityId        links to parent entity
├── value           numeric value
├── unit            "kg" | "hours" | "THB" | "%" | ...
├── note            optional context
├── timestamp       when this was recorded
└── ownerId
```

### Schedule

Defines recurrence for any entity — habits, bills, reviews, automations.

```
Schedule
├── id
├── entityId
├── recurrence      cron expression or simple pattern
├── nextDue         next occurrence timestamp
├── lastCompleted   last completed timestamp
└── isActive        boolean
```

### Relation

Links between entities across modules.

```
Relation
├── fromId          source entity
├── toId            target entity
└── type            "parent" | "blocks" | "relates" | "supports"
```

## Modules

> **Historical.** Eight modules are marked complete below and five of them — Health, Family,
> Places, Travel, Memories and the rest — were deleted at v2.5.0 (the Lean release) and have not
> returned. Wealth came back as the Rust-backed module; Projects came back as its own type in
> September. The live list is `src/core/config/modules.ts`; see
> [`docs/architecture/modules.md`](../architecture/modules.md).

Each module is a thin layer on top of the core engine. 30+ entity types are currently supported.

## Lyra AI

Lyra AI is the intelligence layer that runs across all modules. It is built around three pillars: the Sol personality, MCP-style tools, and proactive detectors.

### Sol — The AI Personality

Sol is an INTJ strategist personality that adapts to time of day and context. Sol is direct, analytical, and focused on helping you execute your strategy.

- **Time-of-day awareness** — morning briefs are energetic and forward-looking; evening reflections are calmer
- **Customizable traits** — adjust directness, verbosity, and coaching style
- **Context-aware** — Sol has access to your entities, trackers, goals, and recent activity

### MCP-Style Tool System

Five registered tools that Sol can invoke:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **suggest-focus** | Analyze priorities and suggest what to work on next |
| **break-down** | Decompose a goal or project into actionable subtasks |
| **analyze-risk** | Identify risks to goals, deadlines, or streaks |
| **coaching** | Provide strategic coaching on decisions or direction |
| **weekly-summary** | Generate a comprehensive weekly review |

### Lyra Page

Full command interface for interacting with Sol:
- **Chat** — conversational interface with full data context
- **Tool Arsenal** — browse and invoke all registered tools
- **Settings** — provider config, personality tuning, context preferences

### Provider-Agnostic

Works with any OpenAI-compatible API:
- **Ollama** (default) — fully local, llama3.2:3b, data never leaves your machine
- **OpenAI** — GPT-4o or similar
- **Claude** — via API
- **Custom** — any endpoint that speaks the OpenAI chat format

### Graceful Degradation

When the AI provider is offline or unavailable:
- Algorithmic fallbacks generate insights from rules and heuristics
- No broken states — the app remains fully functional
- Reconnects automatically when the provider comes back

---

## Proactive Intelligence

> **Historical.** Written before the Lean release; several of the surfaces described here were
> deleted with the Lyra page. The detectors and the morning brief survive in
> `src/core/ai/` — the source is the list; `docs/ai-layer.md` described a Phase-3 shape that no
> longer exists and was deleted. For the *other* MCP, see [`docs/features/mcp.md`](../features/mcp.md).

The system that makes Lyra feel alive. Instead of waiting for you to ask, Lyra watches your data and speaks up when something matters.

### Lyra Pulse

Background detector cycle running every 10 minutes:
- Scans 8 signal detectors across all modules
- Surfaces insights as toast notifications
- Non-intrusive — only alerts on meaningful signals

### Signal Detectors

| Detector | What it watches |
|---|---|
| **Streak Risk** | Habits at risk of breaking their streak today |
| **Stale Projects** | Projects with no activity in 7+ days |
| **Budget Alert** | Categories approaching or exceeding budget |
| **Sleep Quality** | Below-average sleep patterns |
| **Energy Trend** | Declining energy levels |
| **Decision Review** | Decisions due for revisit |
| **Achievements** | Milestones reached (streak records, goal completions) |
| **Velocity** | Task/goal completion velocity changes |

### Morning Brief

Daily briefing that aggregates all 8 detectors into an actionable summary. Generated once per day, cached for the session.

### Deep Work Coach

Active during focus sessions (Pomodoro timer):
- Streak alerts when approaching personal records
- Progress updates on current task
- Next-task suggestions when current task completes

### Session Summary

Toast notification on pomodoro completion:
- Tasks completed during the session
- Time spent breakdown
- Suggested next action

### Real-time Celebrations

Instant recognition when you achieve something:
- Streak milestones (7, 30, 90, 365 days)
- Goal completions
- Project milestones

### Dynamic Dashboard

12 signal-driven widgets that appear based on what matters right now:
- **Rules mode** — automation-driven, deterministic widget selection
- **Lyra mode** — AI-driven, Sol decides what to surface

---

## Integrations

Connectors follow a standard interface. Adding a new integration means implementing one plugin.

### Active Connectors

| Connector | Direction | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Google Calendar** | Pull (iCal) | Done |
| **Ollama** | Bidirectional | Done |

### Planned Connectors

| Connector | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **GitHub** | Pull | Track commits, PRs, contributions |
| **Home Assistant** | Bidirectional | IoT device control and sensor data |
| **Docker API** | Pull + Actions | Container status, restart, logs |
| **Notion** | Pull | Import notes and databases |
| **Bank API** | Pull | Auto-import transactions (future) |
| **Fitbit / Apple Health** | Pull | Auto-import health metrics (future) |

---

## Automation Engine

Event-driven rules that connect triggers to actions.

### Structure

```
Automation
├── name             human-readable label
├── trigger          event that starts the automation
├── conditions[]     optional filters (time, entity type, value thresholds)
├── actions[]        what to do when triggered
└── isActive         on/off toggle
```

### Rule Templates (5 built-in)

| Name | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Streak alert | Habit not checked in by evening | Push reminder notification |
| Overspend warning | Category spend > budget | Alert + flag on dashboard |
| Stale project | No project activity in 7 days | Surface on dashboard |
| Goal deadline | Goal due soon, progress < 80% | Suggest action plan |
| Weekly review | Sunday evening | Generate review prompt |

### User-Created Automations

"When / Then" builder in the UI with conditional logic (AND-based conditions), event-driven triggers, dry-run preview, and execution history.

---

## Tech Stack

> **Historical.** The backend named below was built and then replaced: the API is now one
> Rust binary (axum + sqlx), and SQLite is reached through sqlx with forward-only SQL
> migrations rather than Drizzle. This document is kept as the original design intent —
> see [docs/architecture.md](../architecture/architecture.md) for what actually runs.


| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript 5.9 | Type safety across UI and API, single language |
| UI Framework | React 19 | Stable, massive ecosystem, long-term support |
| Build Tool | Vite 7 | Fast dev server, minimal config, modern defaults |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4 | Utility-first, consistent design, fast iteration |
| Components | Radix / shadcn/ui | Accessible, customizable, you own the code |
| State | Zustand | Minimal boilerplate, scales well |
| API Client | TanStack React Query | Caching, sync, optimistic updates |
| API Server | Hono | Lightweight, TypeScript-native |
| Database | SQLite via Drizzle ORM | Zero-config, file-based, perfect for home server |
| AI | Ollama (local) | Provider-agnostic, OpenAI-compatible API |
| Charts | Recharts | Composable, React-native, good for time-series |
| Auth | JWT | Lightweight, sufficient for local network |
| PWA | vite-plugin-pwa | Installable, offline support |

## Project Boundaries

What Lyra is **not**:

- Not a social network — it is private, family-only
- Not a SaaS product — it is self-hosted, no subscription
- Not a replacement for specialized tools where they are better (IDE, email client, photo editor)
- Not trying to be perfect — it is a living system that improves over time
