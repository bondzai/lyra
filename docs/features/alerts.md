# Alerts — rules, digests, and the two channels

`lyra-alerts` is the outbound half of Lyra's messaging: it decides what is worth saying, and it
says it to every channel configured. It runs in-process inside `lyra-api`, so its upstream caches
are shared with the request path and an alert can never disagree with the page it points at.

This was the most under-documented shipped code in the repo until 2026-09-21. Discord has existed
since `2d79b7f` and appeared in no document at all.

---

## 1. Alert on the edge, not on the level

Every function in `rules.rs` is **pure**: current readings plus previous state in, alerts and new
state out. No clock, no network, no database. That is what makes latches, hysteresis and
once-a-day timing testable without sleeping or stubbing a socket.

A position that is out of range does not ping every fifteen minutes — it pings when it *goes* out.
Which means every rule needs memory, and memory that survives a restart, or a container redeploy
replays every alert you already acknowledged. State lives in the `alert_state` table.

Two hysteresis bands stop a value hovering on a threshold from flapping:

- fees re-arm only after dropping below **half** the threshold (`FEE_RESET_RATIO = 0.5`) — after an
  actual claim, not after a penny of accrual noise;
- a health-factor warning clears only **10% above** the floor (`HF_CLEAR_RATIO = 1.1`), so a
  position wobbling on the line is reported once rather than hourly.

**The first sweep is silent; the second is not.** A fresh `alert_state` baselines without sending.
Once it has a baseline, a real change sends a real message to a real phone. When testing, either
stop the API inside `ALERT_INTERVAL` or leave the channels unset.

## 2. A message before it has a channel

`Message` carries text plus a `Markup` tag, and the tag exists to fix a real bug rather than to
look tidy.

Bot replies are built from on-chain data — pool names, token symbols — and went out with
`parse_mode: Markdown` set. One `*` in a pool name and Telegram rejects the whole request with
`can't parse entities`, so the reply is **silently never delivered**; it surfaces only as
`delivered = false` in a log line. The builders' own comment said "plain text — no Markdown", and
it was right. The transport had no way to know.

| Constructor | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Message::plain` | Prose and untrusted data. **The sender must make it safe for its own syntax.** |
| `Message::telegram_markup` | Authored in Telegram's markdown, passed through untouched |

`Markup::Telegram` doubles as the migration marker: every message still carrying it is one a second
channel can only render as Telegram-flavoured text. The digest is the big one — a few hundred lines
of string building that wants breaking into fields before Discord can show it as an embed.

**Telegram escaping strips rather than backslash-escapes.** Removal cannot produce an unbalanced
entity, and a dropped `*` costs a glyph where a rejected message costs the whole alert. Discord is
kinder — it renders unbalanced markup instead of rejecting the message — so there the text is
escaped and a pool name keeps every character it started with.

**Two markdowns that look alike are the trap worth a translator.** Telegram's legacy mode reads
`*bold*` and `_italic_`; Discord reads `**bold**` and `*italic*`. Passing one to the other unchanged
emphasises every digest heading the wrong way — quietly, and visible only by comparing both
channels side by side. `telegram_to_discord` is deliberately conservative: an unpaired marker is
left alone, and emphasis never spans a line.

## 3. Delivered to every channel — and the argument that used to say otherwise

`Channels::from_env` reads every channel and keeps only the configured ones, so `can_send` is a
question about the list's length rather than a poll of its members.

**`deliver.telegram` now holds each channel to its own outcome.** The handler loops over
`Channels::each()` and wraps every send in `ctx.once("sent:<channel>")`. Because `once` records only
a step that returned `Ok`, a channel that failed is the only one a retry attempts — delivery is
exactly-once *per channel*, using `job_effects` exactly as it already was. The key is the handler's
to choose, and choosing the channel name was the whole fix; there was no schema change. The job stays
unfinished while any channel is still owed the message, and `last_error` names which one.

### Why the old rule was defensible, and what changed

`Channels::send` reports success when **any** channel took the message, and this document used to
argue for that: an alert that reached your phone has done its job, and failing a sweep because
Discord was down would turn redundancy into a new way to lose an alert.

That argument is sound **while the channels are redundant** — two roads to the same person. It stops
being sound the moment they are different destinations. Once money alerts go to one Discord room and
the daily brief goes to Telegram, "any channel took it" is not a success condition at all: the room
that failed is the only one that was supposed to hear. Redundancy and routing want opposite verdicts
from the same function, which is why the verdict moved out of `Channels` and into the caller that
knows which it is doing.

`Channels::send` is still there and still all-or-nothing. It is used by the digest
(`jobs/digest.rs`), the alert sweep's inline sends, and the `/alerts/test` endpoints
(`wealth.rs`) — **so a Discord failure on the daily brief is still masked.** That is not an oversight
left lying around: `wealth::deliver_digest` owns building *and* sending because it advances the delta
snapshot only after a successful send, so "successful" there has to mean something specific before it
can be made per-channel. It is the right thing to settle when delivery becomes routed rather than
fanned out.

The inverse matters as much: when *nothing* is configured the result is `Delivery::NotConfigured`,
never a failure, and the job records that as a completed step. A box with no channels is the ordinary
state of a fresh install, not a fault.

### Testing a channel that fails

`SendError` cannot be built outside `lyra-alerts` — its constructor takes a scrubber so an unscrubbed
failure message cannot exist. So the crate hands out the double instead of the key:
`channels::testing::ScriptedSender` returns outcomes from a script and counts what it was asked to
send. That count is usually the assertion that matters, because "was Telegram asked twice" is a
question no amount of checking a job's status can answer.

### One known wart, documented rather than papered over

`/api/wealth/alerts` still reports `can_send` **for Telegram alone**, so a Discord-only box
delivers alerts while the settings page says it cannot. That field is parity-gated and widening it
would fail the diff. The honest fix is a new ungated route reporting the channel names — the same
move `vfat-status` made. Until then, the discrepancy is real and this paragraph is where it lives.

## 4. The webhook URL *is* the credential

A Discord webhook URL ends in a token: anyone holding the whole URL can post to that channel. So it
gets the same containment as the Telegram bot token, mirroring `telegram.rs` deliberately rather
than inventing a second style.

- `Webhook` has a hand-written `Debug` that prints `[redacted]`, and no `Display`, no `Serialize`,
  no public accessor for the URL.
- The token is a **path segment**, so an HTTP error quoting its URL would publish it. Errors go
  through `SendError` after `without_url()`, then are scrubbed. `SendError`'s constructor requires
  being handed a scrubber, so an unscrubbed message cannot be constructed at all.
- **The host is checked on construction.** A "which host do we post to" setting is a
  credential-exfiltration switch, so a URL that is not Discord's is refused outright. `http://` is
  refused too.

Bodies past Discord's 4096-character embed limit are cut with a visible mark, because a brief that
arrives shortened beats one that does not arrive. Telegram's own 4096 limit is handled differently
and better: `split_for_telegram` splits an over-long message on blank lines, then newlines, then
characters, so a long brief arrives as several messages rather than being truncated or refused. See
[`docs/features/telegram.md` §6](./telegram.md).

### Why an embed rather than plain text

Plain text is what Telegram is for, and it renders a digest as a wall. Discord's value is that a
message can carry structure: a coloured stripe, a title, and up to 6000 characters across 25
fields. Today it sends one embed with a description, and leaves fields for when `Message` itself
carries them.

## 5. Configuration

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | The Telegram channel. Unset, the sweep still runs and records state without sending — the right first-boot state |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | The Discord channel. The full webhook URL, token and all. **This is a credential — back it up with `.env.local` and treat a leak as a channel takeover.** The host is validated, so a typo fails at construction rather than posting your portfolio somewhere else |
| `ALERT_INTERVAL` | Seconds between sweeps, default 900 |
| `DIGEST_HOUR` | Local hour for the daily brief. **Unset means no digest is ever sent** |
| `ALERT_FEE_USD` / `ALERT_HF` / `ALERT_REPORT_CCY` | The thresholds and the reporting currency |

Setting either channel turns on live delivery to a live phone or channel. See
[Deployment §7.1](../operations/deployment.md).

## 6. What the queue changes

Today a failed alert send is logged and lost — `alert_loop` swallows the error, and the digest's
day key is only written on success, so a Telegram outage at digest hour costs the day's brief
silently. Stage D of [the assistant roadmap](../assistant-roadmap.md) turns delivery into a
`deliver.telegram` job with real backoff, which for a health-factor warning is the difference
between an alarm and a log line.
